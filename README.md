# react-native-typescript-expo

A demo app showing how you can use:

* React Native
* Expo
* Jest
* TypeScript
* Visual Studio Code

## Motivation

I couldn't find an example to demonstrate how to get typescript and react native running with expo.

## Prerequisites

node.js installed with npm 3 (not 4)

## Getting up and running

``git clone url``

Then run

``yarn``

**_Note: It's important that the App.js not be renamed because expo expects that file to be there and is not configurable by the ```entryPoint``` config entry in ```app.json```._**

How does this look.
